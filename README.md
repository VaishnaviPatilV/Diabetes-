# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📘 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of diabetes in patients using machine learning techniques.  
The dataset contains medical and personal health features, and the goal is to build a model that can assist in early diagnosis of diabetes.  

## ✨ Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the dataset  
- Data preprocessing and feature selection  
- Implementation of multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)  
- Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report  
- Visualizations for better understanding  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Libraries:  
  - **Pandas, NumPy** → Data handling  
  - **Matplotlib, Seaborn** → Visualization  
  - **Scikit-learn** → Machine Learning models and evaluation  
  - **XGBoost** → Advanced boosting algorithm
